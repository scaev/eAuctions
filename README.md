## Installation

To run this application, you'll need to have Python 3 and Django installed on your system. You can install Django using pip:
pip install django
Once you have Django installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the root directory:
git clone https://github.com/scaev/eAuctions.git
cd eAuctions
You'll need to apply the migrations to create the database tables:
python manage.py migrate
You can then start the development server:
python manage.py runserver
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.

## Usage

To use the application, you'll need to create an account. You can do this by clicking the "Sign Up" link on the home page and filling out the registration form.

Once you're logged in, you can create a new auction by clicking the "Sell" link on the home page. You'll need to provide a title, description, starting price, and end time for the auction.

Other users can then bid on your auction by entering a higher price on the auction page. The highest bid will be displayed on the auction page, and the auction will automatically close when the end time is reached.
