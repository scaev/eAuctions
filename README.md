- git clone https://github.com/scaev/eAuctions.git
- cd eAuctions
- You'll need to apply the migrations to create the database tables:

## Usage

To use the application, you'll need to create an account. You can do this by clicking the "Sign Up" link on the home page and filling out the registration form.

Once you're logged in, you can create a new auction by clicking the "Sell" link on the home page. You'll need to provide a title, description, starting price, and end time for the auction.

Other users can then bid on your auction by entering a higher price on the auction page. The highest bid will be displayed on the auction page, and the auction will automatically close when the end time is reached.
